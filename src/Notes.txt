# Deployment

## Visual Studio
* Right click the server project and choose Publish
* If it asks you to sign in and doesn't return any values, make sure you have an Azure subscription
* Enter the details and click the publish button

## Powershell (Requires Azure CLI)
* Run the "build.ps1" script to generate the zip file to publish
* Find your Azure subscription id from the Portal (Under Subscriptions on the home screen)
* Run the "deploy.ps1" script with the subscription id and a name for the app
	* If you get a "The subscription of xxx' doesn't exist in cloud 'AzureCloud'" warning, run the `az login` command
