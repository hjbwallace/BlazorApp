# Deployment

## Visual Studio
* Right click the server project and choose Publish
* If it asks you to sign in and doesn't return any values, make sure you have an Azure subscription
* Enter the details and click the publish button

## Powershell (Requires Azure CLI)
* Run the "build.ps1" script to generate the zip file to publish
* Find your Azure subscription id from the Portal (Under Subscriptions on the home screen)
* Run the "deploy.ps1" script with the subscription id and a name for the app
	* If you get a "The subscription of xxx' doesn't exist in cloud 'AzureCloud'" warning, run the `az login` command

# Automation
https://github.com/Azure/login
* Add secret to Github Repo > Settings > Secrets

# Actions
* Conditional jobs: https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Github-Actions-CI-CD-Need-optional-jobs/td-p/29696
* https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

## Deployment Errors
Github actions prepends $ErrorActionPreference = 'stop' to scripts which causes the scripts to stop on any warnings or errors
The az webapp deploy step always seems to throw a warning which then causes the step to fail. Following github issue was raised with a very similar issue.
